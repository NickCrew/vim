# My Vim Repo

* My vim environment is optimized primarily for: Python, ansible and config tools, asciidoc and textfiles.
* For python code completion to work you will need to python-lsp-server package installed on your system.  
* You will need a linter installed, such as Flake8 for ALE to work.
* Powerline fonts may be needed for proper airline display
