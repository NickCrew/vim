# My Vim Repo

* __My vim environment is optimized primarily for:__ Python, Ansible, Hashicorp tools, Asciidoc and markdown editing.  
  
* You should probably look into the code completion and async plug-ins if you're planning on using them.  
  
  
* You need the patched powerline fonts for vim-airline: https://github.com/powerline/fonts  
  

__To install plugins you need to:__  
1. `mkdir -p ~/.vim/plugged`  
2. Run `:PlugInstall` inside of vim  
I use *vim-plug*: https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug  

Traditional Vim wisdom says you should try not to use unnecessary plug-ins or at least explore Vim's native
functionality first to see what your needs are. I agree but you are your own human (hopefully).
